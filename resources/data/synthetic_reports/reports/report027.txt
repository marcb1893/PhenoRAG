Patient presents with fever, nephritis, and prostatitis, accompanied by rigors.
History of Present Illness
The patient is a 56-year-old male presenting with a 4-day history of febrile episodes, characterized by sudden sensations of feeling cold and episodes of shivering. The patient reports experiencing pronounced chills, particularly in the evening, with visible pallor during these episodes. Temperature readings at home have ranged from 38.4°C to 39.1°C.
The patient has been experiencing symptoms consistent with urological issues for approximately one week. Diagnostic evaluation has confirmed the presence of kidney inflammation (nephritis) and inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis). The patient reports appropriate energy levels and has remained active despite his illness, showing no signs of lethargy or sluggishness in daily activities.
Past Medical History

Hypertension (diagnosed 5 years ago, well-controlled)
Hypercholesterolemia
No known allergies
No previous history of urological conditions

Medications

Lisinopril 10mg daily
Atorvastatin 20mg daily

Physical Examination
Vital Signs:

Temperature: 38.7°C
Blood Pressure: 138/85 mmHg
Heart Rate: 92 bpm
Respiratory Rate: 18/min
O2 Saturation: 97% on room air

General: Patient appears mildly distressed due to current symptoms but is alert and oriented x3. Patient experienced a chill during examination, with observable shivering and transient pallor. No signs of lethargy; patient is engaged and responsive throughout examination.
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Mucous membranes are slightly dry.
Cardiovascular: Tachycardic but regular rhythm. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No crackles or wheezes.
Abdominal: Soft, non-distended. No hepatosplenomegaly.
Genitourinary: Digital rectal examination reveals tender, enlarged, and warm prostate consistent with prostatitis.
Musculoskeletal: Normal muscle tone and strength in all extremities. Full range of motion.
Neurological: Grossly intact. Patient demonstrates normal reaction time and mental alertness.
Laboratory and Diagnostic Results
Urinalysis:

WBC: 80-100/hpf (elevated)
RBC: 15-25/hpf (elevated)
Leukocyte esterase: Positive
Nitrites: Positive
Bacteria: Moderate

Blood Work:

WBC: 14.3 × 10^9/L (elevated)
Neutrophils: 78% (elevated)
Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL (slightly elevated)
BUN: 23 mg/dL (elevated)
CRP: 8.7 mg/dL (significantly elevated)
ESR: 45 mm/hr (elevated)
PSA: 7.2 ng/mL (elevated)

Imaging:
Renal ultrasound shows bilateral renal enlargement with increased echogenicity consistent with nephritis. Prostate ultrasound reveals an enlarged prostate (45cc) with heterogeneous echotexture and increased vascularity, consistent with prostatitis.
Microbiology:

Urine culture: Pending
Blood culture: Pending

Assessment

Acute bacterial nephritis - likely pyelonephritis
Acute bacterial prostatitis
Sepsis syndrome with fever and chills
No evidence of lethargy or fatigue

Plan

Antimicrobial therapy:

Ceftriaxone 2g IV daily
Transition to oral antibiotics based on culture results


Supportive care:

Intravenous fluid hydration
Antipyretics for fever and chills
Alpha-blocker (Tamsulosin 0.4mg daily) for prostatic symptoms


Monitoring:

Daily renal function tests
Follow-up imaging in 48-72 hours
Serial vital signs with particular attention to fever patterns and chills


Hospital admission:

Admit to medical floor for IV antibiotics and close monitoring
Consider Urology consultation


Follow-up care:

Reassessment of renal and prostatic inflammation after 3 days of therapy
Adjust antibiotics based on culture results
Outpatient follow-up with Urology and Nephrology upon discharge



Additional Notes
Patient demonstrates good understanding of his condition. Despite the severity of his infection, he maintains normal energy levels and appropriate engagement. The constellation of nephritis and prostatitis suggests a complex urological infection requiring careful management. Patient has been counseled regarding the importance of completing the full course of antibiotics.
