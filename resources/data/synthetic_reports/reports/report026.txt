Leukocyte esterase: Positive
Bacteria: Moderate

Assessment

Acute right flank pain due to ureterolithiasis (5mm proximal ureteral stone)
Urinary bladder inflammation (cystitis) with evidence of bacterial infection
Mild hydronephrosis secondary to ureteral obstruction
No evidence of pollakisuria, chills, or lethargy

Plan

Pain management:

Prescription for NSAID (Ketorolac) for management of kidney pain
Instructions for proper hydration and application of heat to flank area


Antibiotic therapy:

Ciprofloxacin 500mg BID for 7 days to address the urinary bladder inflammation
Urine culture pending for targeted therapy


Follow-up plan:

Return in 3 days for reassessment of symptoms
Repeat urinalysis at follow-up
Consider CT urogram if no improvement


Patient education:

Advised on increased fluid intake
Strain urine to check for stone passage
Return to ED immediately if new symptoms develop including chills, lethargy, or unusual urination patterns
