CLINICAL ASSESSMENT REPORT
Date: February 21, 2025
Time: 14:30
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Patient presents with ongoing urinary tract symptoms and general malaise developing over the past week.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient, a 42-year-old female describes intermittent discomfort in the left posterolateral region, which occasionally radiates. Physical examination revealed moderate tenderness upon deep palpation of the costovertebral angle. Temperature fluctuations were noted during evening hours, with the patient reporting occasional rigors and cold sensations despite normal temperature readings.
UROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT:
Patient reports experiencing a burning sensation during micturition. Notably, bathroom visits have increased significantly beyond her baseline pattern. The patient maintains adequate fluid intake but expresses frustration with the need for frequent toilet visits.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital Signs:

BP: 128/82 mmHg
HR: 88 bpm
RR: 16/min
Temp: 37.8Â°C

General appearance: Skin is warm and appropriately perfused, though the patient was observed wrapping herself in the examination room blanket despite moderate room temperature.
ASSESSMENT:
Clinical findings suggest an acute urological condition with systemic manifestations. The combination of micturition-related symptoms and costovertebral angle tenderness raises concern for potential ascending infection.
PLAN:

Urine culture and sensitivity
Complete blood count
Consider empiric antibiotic therapy pending culture results
Follow-up appointment scheduled for one week
