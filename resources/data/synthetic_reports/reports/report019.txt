The patient, a 56-year-old male, presents with a long-standing history of general malaise and fatigue. He reports feeling mentally and physically drained throughout the day, often struggling to perform routine tasks despite an apparent desire to engage in daily activities. This has gradually worsened over the past few weeks, although he denies feelings of indifference to tasks.

While his appetite has remained stable, he has noted some disturbances in his sleeping patterns, often waking in the early morning hours. He attributes this to discomfort in his lower back, though the sensation has never been identified as acute. He experiences intermittent sensations of coldness, especially during the late afternoon, which seem to resolve after a short period of rest. These episodes have been consistent but not bothersome enough to interrupt his day-to-day responsibilities.

Upon further questioning, he reports an increase in the frequency of urination, with trips to the bathroom more often than usual. However, he denies any pain or discomfort associated with urination, despite the increased frequency. His last routine check-up showed no abnormal kidney function.

The patientâ€™s vital signs are within normal ranges, and a physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities aside from a minor decrease in stamina when performing physical activities.
