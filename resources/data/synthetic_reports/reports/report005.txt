Clinical Report

Patient: Male, 52 years old
Chief Complaint: Generalized fatigue and urinary complaints

History of Present Illness:
The patient reports a gradual decline in overall energy levels, describing a persistent heaviness in completing routine tasks despite sufficient rest. He mentions occasional urinary discomfort, particularly a fleeting sensation during voiding that he attributes to mild irritation rather than overt pain. Additionally, he has noticed an increased tendency to wake up at night to urinate, although he denies any drastic changes in overall fluid intake.

When asked about temperature regulation, he denies experiencing any sudden cold sensations or involuntary shivering episodes in recent weeks. No complaints of localized side pain, and he has not required any positional adjustments to alleviate discomfort.

Review of Systems:

    General: Reports feeling “less driven” but remains engaged in daily activities.
    Genitourinary: Some urinary urgency noted, though no burning or significant distress.
    Musculoskeletal: No notable aches or pains.
    Neurological: Mild sluggishness but no reported confusion or disorientation.

Assessment & Plan:
The patient’s symptoms warrant further assessment for potential metabolic or urological contributors. A basic metabolic panel and urinalysis will be conducted to rule out infection or underlying systemic causes. Recommendations include maintaining hydration, monitoring symptom progression, and considering a follow-up if symptoms persist or worsen.
