Clinical Report

The patient, a 38-year-old female, presented with complaints of persistent fatigue and difficulty carrying out everyday tasks. Over the past few weeks, she has felt significantly slower in initiating even routine activities, a change from her previous ability to perform with ease. Despite a strong desire to stay active, she finds herself often unable to muster the energy to engage in social or personal activities. While she described moments of extreme tiredness, no complaints of persistent indifference or disinterest in tasks were voiced. The fatigue appears to persist throughout the day, and on some occasions, even the most basic tasks feel overwhelming. However, a gradual improvement in energy levels has been noted recently.

The patient also reports occasional discomfort in her lower abdomen, although she did not identify any sharp pain. She mentioned an aching sensation that comes and goes, and it seems to be localized on the right side, closer to the flank. This discomfort is not severe but is frequent enough to warrant some concern. Urination has not been a source of consistent discomfort, though she noted the need to urinate more than usual. 

On physical examination, her temperature was within the normal range, and there were no signs of sweating or shivering episodes. She denied any sensation of extreme cold or any episodes where she felt abnormally chilly. There was no sign of dehydration or pallor. The examination revealed no significant findings related to the urinary system except for the increased frequency of urination, but no pain was elicited during palpation.
