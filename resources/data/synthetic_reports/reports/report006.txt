Clinical Report

Patient Name: [Redacted]
Age/Sex: 47/M
Date of Admission: February 20, 2025
Chief Complaint: Generalized malaise and intermittent discomfort

History of Present Illness:
The patient presents with a recent history of nonspecific fatigue, reporting that routine activities feel disproportionately effortful despite motivation to complete them. While no overt distress is noted, he describes a persistent sense of sluggishness that has made it difficult to maintain his usual pace. His appetite remains stable, though he mentions that his fluid intake has increased slightly due to an ongoing feeling of dryness.

In the past week, he has also noted a subtle but recurrent discomfort localized to the lower back, particularly on the right side, though he denies any acute tenderness on palpation. He has not experienced any significant fevers, but on direct questioning, he recalls a few instances of transient cold sensations in the evenings, which he initially attributed to ambient temperature fluctuations.

The patient does report some difficulty initiating urination at times but denies any significant burning sensation. Episodes of urgency have become more noticeable, with occasional awakenings at night to void. However, there is no associated hematuria or incontinence.

Review of Systems:

    General: No fever, but occasional temperature fluctuations noted
    Neurological: No confusion or significant mental status changes, but describes an unusual heaviness when engaging in routine tasks
    Genitourinary: Increased urinary frequency reported; no gross hematuria, but some hesitancy at onset of voiding
    Musculoskeletal: Mild discomfort in the lumbar region without radiation

Physical Examination:

    Vitals: Afebrile, BP 124/78 mmHg, HR 72 bpm
    General Appearance: Alert, cooperative, and in no acute distress
    Abdomen: No organomegaly, mild right flank tenderness on deep palpation
    Neurological: No focal deficits, normal gait

Assessment & Plan:

    Mild fatigue with exertion – Consider evaluation for metabolic causes, hydration status, and sleep quality
    Right-sided lumbar discomfort – Possible musculoskeletal etiology vs. early renal involvement; recommend further imaging if persistent
    Urinary changes – Likely benign, but a urinalysis and culture will be obtained to rule out infection
    Intermittent cold sensations – No overt signs of systemic infection; monitor for progression

Impression:
While there is no clear evidence of acute pathology at this time, the patient’s constellation of symptoms warrants continued observation, particularly in the context of genitourinary changes and intermittent temperature sensitivity. A follow-up will be scheduled pending laboratory results.
