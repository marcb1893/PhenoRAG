Clinical Report:

The patient, a 45-year-old male, presents with a 7-day history of increasing fatigue. Over the course of the week, he has noted an overwhelming sense of being drained, particularly in the afternoons. He struggles with initiating even basic tasks, finding it difficult to engage in his normal routine, despite no major changes to his usual sleep patterns. This lack of energy has hindered his ability to participate in social activities. He denies any recent changes in appetite, mood, or overall physical health that could explain this persistent fatigue.

Regarding temperature sensitivity, the patient reports no unusual feelings of being chilled or cold episodes. There has been no shivering, body aches, or cold sweats at any point during the illness.

Additionally, the patient notes mild, intermittent discomfort in his right flank, described as a dull, aching sensation between the ribs and hip. The pain does not radiate and is only slightly aggravated with physical exertion. No associated trauma, swelling, or tenderness to palpation is noted in the abdominal or flank regions.

The patient also reports increased frequency of urination. He has also experienced mild pain during urination, described as a dull burning sensation, though he denies any difficulty starting or stopping urination. There has been no hematuria, changes in the color of urine, or retention.
