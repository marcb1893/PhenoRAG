COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL ASSESSMENT
Date: February 21, 2025
Time: 16:20
PRESENTING HISTORY:
52-year-old female presents for follow-up evaluation of ongoing symptoms. Initial complaints from two weeks ago have evolved significantly.
INTERVAL HISTORY:
Patient reports marked improvement in previously documented rigors and cold sensations, which have now completely resolved. The episodes of shivering that dominated the initial presentation no longer occur.
Recent screening questionnaires demonstrate sustained motivation and interest in daily activities, though the patient's capacity to initiate and complete tasks remains notably diminished. Family members report her movements and responses continue to be markedly slower than baseline.
CURRENT SYMPTOMS:
Patient endorses persistent discomfort in the right posterolateral trunk region, which intensifies with movement. The pain radiates from the lower costal margin to the iliac crest, particularly pronounced during deep inspiration.
The previously reported burning sensation during voiding episodes persists despite completed antibiotic course. Patient maintains voiding diary showing urinary frequency within normal parameters, with typical intervals between micturition remaining unchanged from pre-illness baseline.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital Signs:

Temperature: 36.8Â°C
Blood Pressure: 118/74 mmHg
Heart Rate: 82 bpm
Respiratory Rate: 16/min
O2 Saturation: 98% on room air

General: Patient demonstrates delayed initiation of movement during position changes. Alert but with prolonged latency in responses.

ASSESSMENT & PLAN:

Trending toward partial resolution of initial symptom complex
New imaging studies ordered
Nephrology consultation pending
Adjustment of current medication regimen
Follow-up scheduled in one week

Primary diagnostic considerations include evolving pyelonephritis with potential structural complications.
