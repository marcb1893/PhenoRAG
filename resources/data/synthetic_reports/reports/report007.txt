The patient, a 45-year-old female, presents with a number of symptoms consistent with a systemic illness. She reports a general sense of fatigue and sluggishness, making it difficult to complete daily tasks. Despite her desire to maintain usual activities, she experiences a noticeable lack of energy, which has persisted for several days. This fatigue has been accompanied by intermittent discomfort in her side, particularly between the ribs and hips, which she describes as a dull ache. She has also mentioned an increase in the frequency of urination. In addition to these symptoms, she is experiencing occasional difficulty when urinating, which she attributes to a mild burning sensation. At times, she experiences a sudden cold sensation, but there is no shivering or visible pallor noted at these episodes.
