Patient Information
Name: [Patient Name]
DOB: [Date of Birth]
Date of Examination: February 27, 2025
Physician: Dr. [Physician Name]
Chief Complaint
Patient presents with painful urination, diagnosed nephrolithiasis, and urinary bladder inflammation.
History of Present Illness
The patient is a 42-year-old male who presents with a 3-day history of burning discomfort during urination. He describes a dull burning sensation that intensifies toward the end of the urinary stream. The patient reports that urination has become increasingly difficult and painful over the past 24 hours.
The patient was diagnosed with kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) following a CT scan performed at the emergency department. The scan revealed multiple renal calculi, with the largest measuring 6mm in the right kidney and a 4mm stone in the left kidney.
The patient appears alert and engaged during the examination, demonstrating no signs of lethargy or sluggishness. He responds promptly to questions and moves without difficulty, showing normal energy levels and activity.
The patient's temperature is notably below normal at 36.1°C, which has persisted for the past two days according to home measurements.

Laboratory and Diagnostic Results
Urinalysis:

Color: Cloudy
pH: 6.5
Specific gravity: 1.025
Protein: Trace
Glucose: Negative
Ketones: Negative
Blood: 3+ (significant)
Leukocyte esterase: Positive
Nitrites: Positive
WBC: 30-50/hpf (elevated)
RBC: 50-100/hpf (significantly elevated)
Bacteria: Moderate
Crystals: Calcium oxalate crystals present

Blood Work:

WBC: 11.2 × 10^9/L (elevated)
Neutrophils: 75% (elevated)
Hemoglobin: 14.2 g/dL (normal)
Platelets: 210 × 10^9/L (normal)
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL (normal)
BUN: 18 mg/dL (normal)
Sodium: 138 mEq/L
Potassium: 4.2 mEq/L
Chloride: 102 mEq/L
Bicarbonate: 24 mEq/L
Calcium: 9.8 mg/dL (normal)
Uric acid: 7.2 mg/dL (slightly elevated)

Imaging:
CT scan (performed 1 week ago): Multiple renal calculi bilaterally. Right kidney shows a 6mm stone in the lower pole and two smaller stones (2-3mm). Left kidney shows a 4mm stone in the middle calyces. No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Renal ultrasound (today): Confirms nephrolithiasis. Bladder wall shows increased thickness (6mm) with mucosal irregularities, consistent with urinary bladder inflammation.
Urine Culture:
Pending (collected today)
Assessment

Acute bacterial cystitis (urinary bladder inflammation) with dysuria
Nephrolithiasis, bilateral, with multiple renal calculi
Urinary tract infection, likely secondary to obstruction and stasis
Subnormal body temperature (36.1°C)
No evidence of lethargy; patient maintains normal energy and activity levels

Plan

Antibiotic therapy:

Ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily for 7 days for treatment of urinary bladder inflammation
Emphasize completion of full course


Stone management:

Continue Tamsulosin 0.4mg daily to facilitate stone passage
Increase fluid intake to 3L daily
Low sodium, normal calcium diet
Consider urology referral if stones do not pass within 2 weeks


Symptomatic relief:

Phenazopyridine 200mg three times daily for 2 days for dysuria
NSAIDs (Ibuprofen 600mg every 6 hours as needed) for discomfort


Metabolic evaluation:

24-hour urine collection for stone risk factors once infection resolves
Serum PTH, 25-OH Vitamin D to rule out metabolic causes


Temperature monitoring:

Daily temperature checks at home
Return if temperature falls below 36.0°C


Follow-up:

Phone call in 3 days to review urine culture results
Office visit in 2 weeks for reassessment
Repeat imaging in 4 weeks if symptomatic



Additional Notes
The patient demonstrates good understanding of his condition and management plan. He shows appropriate engagement in his care, with no evidence of mental slowing or physical inactivity. He is advised to maintain a high fluid intake and to strain his urine to check for stone passage. The patient is instructed to return immediately if symptoms worsen, particularly if he experiences high fever, uncontrolled pain, nausea/vomiting, or inability to urinate.
