The patient, a 52-year-old male, presents with a series of concerning symptoms that have developed gradually over the past week. He describes feeling unusually tired, often struggling to start or complete routine tasks, though he expresses a strong desire to remain active. This persistent fatigue is coupled with a noticeable discomfort in his side, which he attributes to a mild, nagging pain on the right side, between his ribs and hip. He also reports an increased nocturnal urinary frequency, which disrupts his sleep. His trips to the bathroom have been accompanied by a slight burning sensation when passing urine, though no other significant pain is felt. While he occasionally feels an unexplained sensation of coldness, there is no shivering, nor has he observed any paleness during these episodes.
