* The patient presented with a notable decrease in muscle tone, characterized by diminished resistance to passive stretching, consistent with hypotonia.
* Upon examination, the child was found to have low muscle tone, affecting their overall muscle strength and movement.
* Clinical assessment revealed hypotonia, which was evident from the reduced resistance to movement in the patient's muscles.
* The physical examination noted a significant decrease in muscle tone, suggestive of an underlying neurological or muscular issue.
* Hypotonia was observed in the patient, manifesting as a lack of tension in the muscles, even when at rest.
* Decreased muscle tone was a prominent feature in this patient, with hypotonia being a primary concern for their motor development.
* The patient's muscle tone was found to be abnormally low, indicating hypotonia, which may be related to a central or peripheral nervous system issue.
* Examination of the patient revealed diminished muscle tone, characteristic of hypotonia, which can be associated with various genetic and neurological disorders.
* Low muscle tone was a notable finding in this patient, consistent with a diagnosis of hypotonia, which requires further investigation to determine the underlying cause.
* The patient exhibited hypotonia, with reduced muscle tone affecting their ability to maintain posture and perform movements.
* Assessment of the patient's muscle tone revealed hypotonia, which may be indicative of an underlying abnormality in the central nervous system or peripheral neuromuscular system.
* The child's hypotonia was evident from their floppiness and lack of resistance to passive movement.
* The patient's hypotonia was characterized by a decrease in muscle tone, which was not accompanied by significant muscle weakness.
* Physical examination revealed hypotonia, with the patient's muscles showing reduced tension and resistance to movement.
* The patient presented with muscular hypotonia, which was associated with decreased muscle strength and mobility.
* Hypotonia was diagnosed in the patient, with low muscle tone being a primary feature of their condition.
* The patient's low muscle tone, indicative of hypotonia, was observed to be affecting their motor skills and overall development.
* The child was found to have central hypotonia, characterized by decreased muscle tone and hyperreflexia.
* Examination of the patient revealed peripheral hypotonia, with decreased muscle tone and diminished reflexes.
* The patient exhibited muscular hypotonia, with low muscle tone affecting their ability to perform daily activities.
* The patient's muscle tone was found to be decreased, consistent with a diagnosis of hypotonia, which requires further evaluation to determine the underlying cause.
* The child's hypotonia was characterized by a lack of muscle tone, which was affecting their posture and movement.
* The patient presented with hypotonia, which was associated with decreased muscle strength and endurance.
* Physical examination revealed low muscle tone, consistent with hypotonia, which may be related to a neurological or muscular disorder.
* The patient's hypotonia was evident from their decreased resistance to passive movement and lack of muscle tone.
* The child was diagnosed with hypotonia, which was characterized by decreased muscle tone and reduced mobility.
* The patient exhibited low or weak muscle tone, consistent with a diagnosis of hypotonia, which requires further investigation to determine the underlying cause.
