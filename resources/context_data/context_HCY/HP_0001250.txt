* The patient presented with a sudden onset of seizure activity, characterized by tonic-clonic movements and loss of consciousness.
* EEG findings revealed abnormal excessive neuronal activity, consistent with a seizure disorder.
* Clinical observation noted a transient occurrence of signs and symptoms suggestive of a seizure.
* The infant was diagnosed with electrographic seizures, which were only detectable through EEG monitoring and lacked clinical correlation.
* Recurrent febrile seizures were observed in the patient, but a diagnosis of epilepsy was not made due to the febrile context.
* Abnormal synchronous neuronal activity was detected on EEG, indicating a seizure event.
* The patient's seizure threshold was abnormally reduced, making them more susceptible to recurrent seizures.
* Epileptic seizures were reported by the patient's family, but further evaluation was needed to confirm the diagnosis.
* A seizure-like episode was witnessed, but further testing was required to determine the underlying cause.
* The patient experienced a seizure lasting several minutes, characterized by convulsive movements and altered mental status.
* EEG results showed evidence of seizure activity, including spike and wave discharges.
* The child was found to have a history of seizures, which were precipitated by fever.
* A seizure protocol was initiated due to concerns about the patient's abnormal neuronal activity.
* The patient's seizure was characterized by a post-ictal phase, during which they were confused and disoriented.
* Seizure activity was suspected in the patient, but imaging studies were needed to rule out other causes.
* The patient's epilepsy diagnosis was made after multiple seizures were documented and evaluated.
* Abnormal brain wave activity was detected, suggestive of a seizure or epileptic activity.
* The patient's seizures were described as generalized, involving both sides of the brain.
* Focal seizure activity was noted, originating from a specific region of the brain.
* The patient experienced a seizure in the context of a febrile illness, but it was not considered epileptic in nature.
* Status epilepticus was diagnosed when the patient's seizure lasted longer than 30 minutes.
* The patient's seizure was characterized by automatisms, including repetitive movements and behaviors.
* The EEG showed a pattern consistent with seizure activity, including rapid spike discharges.
* A seizure alert was issued for the patient due to concerns about their increased risk of seizure.
* The patient's seizures were controlled with medication, but adjustments were needed to optimize their regimen.
* The patient reported experiencing an aura before their seizure, which included visual and sensory disturbances.
* The patient's seizure was provoked by a specific stimulus, including flashing lights and sounds.
* Post-seizure evaluation revealed a transient abnormality of nervous system physiology.
* The patient's seizure activity was associated with significant morbidity, including injury and loss of consciousness.
* Epileptic seizures were suspected in the patient, but further testing was needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes.
* The patient's seizures were found to be resistant to treatment, requiring alternative therapies and management strategies.
* A breakthrough seizure occurred in the patient despite adherence to their medication regimen.
* The patient experienced a seizure cluster, characterized by multiple seizures in a short period.
* Seizure prophylaxis was initiated to reduce the patient's risk of seizure recurrence.
* The patient's seizure was complicated by Todd's paralysis, a temporary weakness or paralysis of a limb.
