* The patient presented with significant hypertonia, resulting in stiff limbs that were challenging to mobilize.
* Increased muscle tone was evident in the upper extremities, making it difficult for the patient to perform daily activities.
* Clinical examination revealed hypertonicity in the lower limbs, characterized by resistance to passive movement.
* The child was diagnosed with muscle hypertonia, which affected their gait and balance.
* Spasticity was noted in the patient's arms, with exaggerated reflexes and increased muscle spasms upon movement.
* Rigidity of muscles was observed in the patient's legs, leading to a decreased range of motion.
* Hypertonia was identified as a major contributing factor to the patient's limited mobility and functional impairment.
* The patient's hypertonicity was managed with a combination of physical therapy and pharmacological interventions.
* Increased muscle tone was most pronounced in the patient's proximal muscles, resulting in significant weakness and stiffness.
* The patient exhibited spasticity and rigidity of muscles, which worsened with attempted movement.
* Electrophysiological studies confirmed the presence of hypertonia, characterized by abnormal muscle activity.
* The patient's gait was affected by hypertonia, resulting in a stiff-legged gait pattern.
* Clinical assessment revealed increased muscle tone in the patient's trunk, leading to poor posture and balance.
* Hypertonicity was observed in the patient's facial muscles, resulting in limited facial expressions.
* The patient's muscle hypertonia was associated with other neurological deficits, including weakness and ataxia.
* Spasticity was a significant component of the patient's hypertonia, with frequent muscle spasms and clonus.
* The patient's hypertonia was exacerbated by fatigue, leading to increased stiffness and decreased mobility.
* Physical examination revealed increased muscle tone in the patient's neck and shoulder muscles, resulting in limited range of motion.
* The patient's hypertonia was characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone, typical of spasticity.
* Hypertonicity was noted in the patient's distal muscles, resulting in clawing of the hands and feet.
* The patient's muscle hypertonia was managed with botulinum toxin injections, which helped to reduce spasticity and improve mobility.
* Increased muscle tone was observed in the patient's abdominal muscles, leading to respiratory difficulties.
* The patient's hypertonia was associated with abnormal posturing, including flexion and extension of the limbs.
* Clinical evaluation revealed hypertonia in the patient's pelvic muscles, resulting in urinary retention and constipation.
* The patient exhibited spasticity and rigidity of muscles, which affected their ability to perform activities of daily living.
* Hypertonicity was observed in the patient's vocal cord muscles, resulting in dysphonia and vocal fatigue.
* The patient's hypertonia was characterized by a catch-and-release phenomenon, typical of spasticity.
* Increased muscle tone was noted in the patient's tongue and oral muscles, leading to dysarthria and dysphagia.
* The patient's muscle hypertonia was associated with other systemic conditions, including cerebral palsy and stroke.
* Hypertonia was a major contributor to the patient's disability, affecting their mobility, communication, and daily functioning.
* The patient's hypertonicity was managed with a multidisciplinary approach, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy.
* Clinical assessment revealed increased muscle tone in the patient's ankle muscles, resulting in foot drop and gait disturbances.
* The patient's spasticity and rigidity of muscles were exacerbated by noxious stimuli, including pain and infection.
* Hypertonia was observed in the patient's hand muscles, resulting in claw hand deformity and limited dexterity.
* The patient's muscle hypertonia was characterized by a decreased range of motion, leading to joint contractures and deformities.
* Increased muscle tone was noted in the patient's back muscles, resulting in scoliosis and kyphosis.
* The patient's hypertonia was associated with other neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease.
